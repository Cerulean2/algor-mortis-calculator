## General info
This project is a simple Algor Mortis calculator for determing time of death It's a small project I made for one of my Forensic Science courses and is mainly for educational use. To use this calculator all you need is to enter the current temperature of a dead person and it will tell you how long that person has been dead for. It's a silly little project, but it's something I made in my spare time.
